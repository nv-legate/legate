LEGION_WARNING = """

All Legate programs must be run with a legion_python interperter. We
recommend that you use the Legate driver script "bin/legate" found
in the installation directory to launch Legate programs as it
provides easy-to-use flags for invoking legion_python. You can see
options for using the driver script with "bin/legate --help". You
can also invoke legion_python directly.

Use "bin/legate --verbose ..." to see some examples of how to call
legion_python directly.
