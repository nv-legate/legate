# Legate

The Legate project makes it easier for programmers to leverage the
power of large clusters of CPUs and GPUs. Using Legate, programs can be
developed and tested on moderately sized data sets on local machines and
then immediately scaled up to larger data sets deployed on many nodes in
the cloud or on a supercomputer, *without any code modifications*.

For more information about Legate's goals, architecture, and functioning,
see the [Legate overview](https://docs.nvidia.com/legate/latest/overview.html).

## Installation

Legate is available from [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html)
on the [legate channel](https://anaconda.org/legate/legate).
See https://docs.nvidia.com/legate/latest/installation.html for details about different
install configurations.

## Documentation

A complete list of available features and APIs can be found in the [Legate
documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/legate/latest/).
