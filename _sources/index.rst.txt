NVIDIA Legate
=============

The Legate project endeavors to democratize computing by making it possible for
all programmers to leverage the power of large clusters of CPUs and GPUs by
running the same code that runs on a desktop or a laptop at scale. Using this
technology, computational and data scientists and researchers can develop and
test programs on moderately sized data sets on local machines and then
immediately scale up to larger data sets deployed on many nodes in the cloud or
on a supercomputer without any code modifications.
