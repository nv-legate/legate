Constraints
===========

``Constraint`` represents a specific partitioning constraint imposed on an argument to a
task. For example, the ``broadcast()`` constraint requires that all leaf tasks get a
complete copy of the argument, instead of a subset. ``align()`` on the other hand mandates
that two arguments must be partitioned in the same way (their pieces align each other).
