Task-Local Buffers
==================

``TaskLocalBuffer`` is a buffer allocated during task execution for use as temporary
storage, or to later "bind" to an unbound ``PhysicalStore``. The lifetime of the buffer is
that of the task body. If the buffer was bound to a store, then the memory of the buffer
is transferred to the store on completion of the task. If the buffer was not bound to a
store, then the buffer is destroyed and the memory is reclaimed by the runtime.
