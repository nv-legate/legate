Physical Store
==============

The ``PhysicalStore`` is the manifestation of (part of) a ``LogicalStore`` within a
task. Where ``LogicalStore`` can be used to abstractly describe the full dataset, with
additional transformations at the logical level (e.g. transposing, reshaping, slicing),
the ``PhysicalStore`` represents the actual piece of the data that a task is accessing.
