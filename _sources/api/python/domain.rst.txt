Domains
=======

``DomainPoint`` and ``Domain`` allow the user to specify specific points or dense
rectangles within N-dimensional spaces. They are often used as task "indices" (to locate a
specific point task within a wider array of tasks), and to describe the overall launch
domain of tasks.

Being essentially a tuple and a pair of tuples, however, they are also more generally
useful.
