Arrays
======

``LogicalArray`` represents a set of one or more ``LogicalStore``s that are partitioned in
a related way, to synthesize a more sophisticated data container. For example, an
integer-type ``LogicalStore`` can be combined with a boolean-type ``LogicalStore`` of the
same size to create a masked integer array.
