Annotation
----------

An ``Annotation`` is a context manager to set library specific annotations that
are to be attached to operations issued within a scope. A typical usage of
``Annotation`` would look like this:

::

  with Annotation(lib_context, { "key1" : "value1", "key2" : "value2", ... }:
    ...

Then each operation in the scope is annotated with the key-value pairs,
which are later rendered in execution profiles.
