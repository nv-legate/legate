Downloading Pre-built Packages
==============================

Legate is available from `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html>`_
on the `legate channel <https://anaconda.org/legate/legate>`_.
Please make sure you have at least conda version 24.1 installed, then create
a new environment containing Legate:

.. code-block:: sh

    conda create -n myenv -c conda-forge -c legate legate

or install it into an existing environment:

.. code-block:: sh

    conda install -c conda-forge -c legate legate

Packages with GPU support are available, and will be chosen automatically by
``conda install`` on systems with GPUs.

In an environment without GPUs available, ``conda install`` will by default
choose a CPU-only package. To install a version with GPU support in such an
environment, use environment variable ``CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA``:

.. code-block:: sh

    CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA="12.2" \
      conda install -c conda-forge -c legate legate

You will probably also want to install some downstream libraries built on top of
Legate, e.g. `cuPyNumeric <https://docs.nvidia.com/cupynumeric>`_:

.. code-block:: sh

    conda install -c conda-forge -c legate cupynumeric


Building and Installing from Source
===================================

Building Legate from source has multiple steps and can involve different dependencies,
depending on your system configuration. For the most up to date instructions for the
latest source code, see :ref:`legate_source_build`.

.. _support_matrix:

Support Matrix
==============

The following table lists Legate's minimum supported versions of major
dependencies.

"Full support" means that the corresponding versions (and all later ones) are
being tested regularly, released as downloadable packages, and are expected to work.
Please report any incompatibility you find against a fully-supported version
by opening a bug.

"Best-effort support" means that the corresponding versions may not be actively packaged
and shipped, but that Legate should be compatible with them. In particular, Legate should
be able to be compiled from source for these configurations.

We may not actively work to fix any incompatibilities discovered under these versions, but
we accept contributions that fix such incompatibilities.

.. list-table:: Support Matrix
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Dependency
     - Full support (min version)
     - Best-effort support (min version)
   * - CPU architecture

Legate is tested and guaranteed to be compatible with Volta and later GPU
architectures. You can use Legate with Pascal GPUs as well, but there could
be issues due to lack of independent thread scheduling. Please report any such
issues by opening a bug.

.. _installation_of_mpi_wrapper:

Installation of the Legate MPI wrapper
======================================

If you encounter runtime failures such as

.. code-block:: sh

   failed to load MPI wrapper: 'some/path/to/liblegate_mpi_wrapper.so' ...

Or if you want to use Legate in combination with a different MPI library than the one it
was compiled against (see the dependencies on the Legate package), e.g. you are on an HPC
cluster and want to use the vendor's MPI library, then you will need to compile and
install the Legate MPI wrapper locally on your machine. See :ref:`FAQ<mpi_wrapper_faq>`
for more information on why this is needed.

In order to build and install the wrapper you will need to have:

- CMake (at least version 3.22.1).
- A C++ compiler.
- A local installation of MPI.
- Write access to the target install directory.

Additionally, there are several environment variables that you can set in order to control
the build and installation process:

.. _influential_mpi_wrapper_vars:

- ``CMAKE``: name or path to the ``cmake`` executable.
- ``CMAKE_ARGS`` or ``CMAKE_CONFIGURE_ARGS``: if set, arguments to be passed to the
  initial CMake configure command. If both are set, ``CMAKE_CONFIGURE_ARGS`` is preferred
  over ``CMAKE_ARGS``.
- ``CMAKE_BUILD_ARGS``: if set, arguments to be passed to the CMake build command.
- ``CMAKE_INSTALL_ARGS``: if set, arguments to be passed to the CMake install command.
- ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``, ``PREFIX``, or ``DESTDIR``: path to which the MPI wrappers
  should be installed. If one or more of these variables is set and not empty, they are
  preferred in the order listed. That is, ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` will be preferred over
  ``PREFIX``, which is preferred over ``DESTDIR``.


Conda installation
------------------

Assume Legate is already installed in a conda environment named ``myenv``. We need to
activate this environment and install the wrapper packages that contain the scripts
necessary to build the wrappers (note the custom channel ``legate/label/gex`` in the
install command):

.. code-block:: sh

    $ conda activate myenv
    $ conda install -c conda-forge -c legate/label/gex legate-mpi-wrapper

When the wrapper package is installed, the instructions for building the wrapper are
displayed:

.. code-block:: sh

    To finish configuring the Legate MPI wrapper, activate your environment and run
    /path-to-myenv/mpi-wrapper/build-mpi-wrapper.sh

To build the wrapper, first activate the ``myenv`` environment:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ conda activate myenv


    --------------------- CONDA/MPI_WRAPPER/ACTIVATE.SH -----------------------

    LEGATE_MPI_WRAPPER=

Note that when the environment is activated without the wrapper built, the activation
script for the wrapper package sets the ``LEGATE_MPI_WRAPPER`` environment variable to an
empty value, since there is no wrapper shared library to find yet.

After the environment is activated, we can build the MPI wrapper:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ /path-to-myenv/mpi-wrapper/build-mpi-wrapper.sh

Once the wrapper is built, reactivate the environment to set the necessary environment
variables:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ conda deactivate


    --------------------- CONDA/MPI_WRAPPER/DEACTIVATE.SH -----------------------

    +++ unset LEGATE_MPI_WRAPPER
    +++ set +x
    $ conda activate myenv


    --------------------- CONDA/MPI_WRAPPER/ACTIVATE.SH -----------------------

    LEGATE_MPI_WRAPPER=/path-to-myenv/mpi-wrapper/lib64/liblgcore_mpi_wrapper.so

Note that the activation script now successfully located the MPI wrapper shared library.

It might also be useful to remove the MPI conda package that Legate was compiled against
(typically ``openmpi``), to make sure that there is only one choice of MPI to use:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ conda uninstall --force openmpi


Source build
------------

.. note::

   When building Legate from source, the MPI wrapper is generally **not needed**. The
   build system will automatically compile and link a default wrapper (using whatever
   implementation of MPI it finds on your system) for you. It is only needed if:

   #. You wish to use a different flavor of MPI at runtime than that which Legate was
      built against.
   #. You wish to package Legate yourself, and want to provide build instructions for
      downstream users, or perhaps invoke the wrapper build during your own package
      installation.


Assuming Legate is installed to a directory called ``/path/to/prefix``, to build and
install the wrappers simply run the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ /path/to/prefix/share/legate/mpi_wrapper/install.bash


The same command also exists in the source directory, under the same directory tree:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ ${LEGATE_DIR}/share/legate/mpi_wrapper/install.bash

This command will build and install the MPI wrappers to the default installation
prefix. To change the default installation prefix, or supply additional arguments to the
build, see the list of :ref:`Influential MPI variables <influential_mpi_wrapper_vars>`.

Once the wrapper is built, Legate must still be instructed to load it (and not the default
wrapper which was built during the original source build). To do so, you must set the
``LEGATE_MPI_WRAPPER`` environment variable to the absolute path to the installed shared
library. Assuming the wrapper was installed to ``/my/prefix/directory``:

.. code-block:: sh

   # On Linux
   $ export LEGATE_MPI_WRAPPER="/my/prefix/directory/lib/legate_mpi_wrapper.so"
   # On macOS
   $ export LEGATE_MPI_WRAPPER="/my/prefix/directory/lib/legate_mpi_wrapper.dylib"


As with any environment variable, you can either ``export`` it once (as above), or set it
before invoking a Legate application:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ LEGATE_MPI_WRAPPER="/path/to/legate_mpi_wrapper.so" ./my_legate_app ...


Installation of the Legate IPython Kernel
=========================================

Please install Legate, then run the following command to install a default
Jupyter kernel:

.. code-block:: sh

    legate-jupyter

If installation is successful, you will see some output like the following:

.. code-block::

    Jupyter kernel spec Legate_SM_GPU (Legate_SM_GPU) has been installed

``Legate_SM_GPU`` is the default kernel name.
