Changes: 24.06
==============
..
   STYLE:
   * Capitalize sentences.
   * Use the imperative tense: Add, Improve, Change, etc.
   * Use a period (.) at the end of entries.
   * Be concise yet informative.
   * If possible, provide an executive summary of the new feature, but do not just repeat
     its doc string. However, if the feature requires changes from the user, then describe
     those changes in detail, and provide examples of the changes required.


.. rubric:: General

- Deprecate ``LegateCheckCUDA()`` and ``LegateCheckCUDAStream()`` in favor of
  ``LEGATE_CHECK_CUDA()`` and ``LEGATE_CHECK_CUDA_STREAM()``. However, unlike most
  deprecations, users are **not** encouraged to use the replacements. Rather, users should
  create their own variants of these macros as both ``LEGATE_CHECK_CUDA()`` and
  ``LEGATE_CHECK_CUDA_STREAM()`` are temporary and will be removed in a future release. As
  they are temporary, their removal will be immediate, and will **not** be precipitated by
  a deprecation period.

.. rubric:: Data

- Remove default constructor for ``LogicalArray``, ``LogicalStore``, ``PhysicalArray``,
  ``PhysicalStore``. These were never "valid" methods to construct these objects, and only
  existed to work around deficiencies in the Cython compiler. Users should use the various
  ``Runtime`` methods to construct these objects instead.

.. rubric:: Mapping

.. rubric:: Partitioning

- Remove default constructor for ``Variable``, and ``Constraint``. These were never
  "valid" methods to construct these objects, and only existed to work around deficiencies
  in the Cython compiler. Users should use the various ``Task`` and constraint-generating
  methods (e.g. ``align()``, ``scale()``) to construct these objects instead.

.. rubric:: Tasks

- Remove default constructor for ``AutoTask``, and ``ManualTask``. These were never
  "valid" methods to construct these objects, and only existed to work around deficiencies
  in the Cython compiler. Users should use the various ``Runtime`` methods to construct
  these objects instead.
- Allow declaring default task ``VariantOption``'s per variant inline within the task
  declaration. If present, these default options will be used at task registration. See
  ``LegateTask`` for further discussion.

.. rubric:: Types

- Deprecate ``type_code_of`` in favor of ``type_code_of_v``, as the latter is more
  idiomatically named in C++. In the future ``type_code_of`` may be changed to hold a
  ``value`` member to also be inline with idiomatic C++.
- Deprecate ``type_of`` in favor of ``type_of_t``, as the latter is more idiomatically
  named in C++. In the future ``type_of`` will be changed to hold a ``type`` member to
  also be inline with idiomatic C++.

.. rubric:: Runtime

- Remove default constructor for ``Library``, and ``Type``. These were never "valid"
  methods to construct these objects, and only existed to work around deficiencies in the
  Cython compiler. Users should use the various ``Runtime`` methods to construct these
  objects instead.
- Add ``Runtime::get_executing_processor()``.

.. rubric:: Utilities

- Rename ``<core/cuda_help.h>`` to ``<core/cuda.h>``. While this header is publicly
  exported, it is only done so out of necessity, and users are encouraged not to rely on
  it.
