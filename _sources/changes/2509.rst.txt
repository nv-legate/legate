==============

..
   STYLE:
   * Capitalize sentences.
   * Use the imperative tense: Add, Improve, Change, etc.
   * Use a period (.) at the end of entries.
   * Be concise yet informative.
   * If possible, provide an executive summary of the new feature, but do not
     just repeat its doc string. However, if the feature requires changes from
     the user, then describe those changes in detail, and provide examples of
     the changes required.


.. rubric:: General

- Define ``LEGION_DISABLE_DEPRECATED_ENUMS`` in ``legate_defines.h``, which disables the
  use of deprecated Legion enum values. Uses of these values will now result in
  compile-time errors.

C++
---

.. rubric:: General

- Add config option ``--profile-name`` to customize the base filename for profiling
  output.
- Add new UCX networking backend. On supporting builds (``LEGATE_DEFINED(LEGATE_USE_UCX)``
  being ``1``), CPU collectives can be routed through UCX by disabling
  MPI (``LEGATE_CONFIG=--disable-mpi``).
- Remove support for Cal communicator.
- Remove ``LEGATE_USE_CAL`` macro definition.
- Support for ``cal`` communicator via ``legate.AutoTask.add_communicator("cal")``
  and ``legate.ManualTask.add_communicator("cal")`` have been removed.

.. rubric:: Data

.. rubric:: Mapping

.. rubric:: Partitioning

- Add overload of ``legate::align()`` that takes a span of variables to align as a
  convenience for aligning multiple task arguments.
- Add overload of ``legate::broadcast()`` that takes a span of variables to broadcast as a
  convenience for broadcasting multiple task arguments.
- Add overload of ``legate::broadcast()`` that takes a span of pairs of variables and axes
  to broadcast as a convenience for broadcasting multiple task arguments.

.. rubric:: Tasks

.. rubric:: Types

.. rubric:: Runtime

.. rubric:: Utilities

- Remove previously deprecated classes ``legate::cuda::StreamPool`` and
  ``legate::cuda::StreamView``.

.. rubric:: I/O


Python
------

.. rubric:: General

- Remove ``legate.core.AutoTask.add_cal_communicator()``.
- Remove ``legate.core.ManualTask.add_cal_communicator()``.
- Remove support for passing ``"cal"`` to ``legate.core.AutoTask.add_communicator()``
  and ``legate.core.ManualTask.add_communicator()``.

.. rubric:: Data

.. rubric:: Mapping

.. rubric:: Partitioning

- Change ``legate.core.align()`` to return an iterable of constraints instead of a single
  value.
- Change ``legate.core.broadcast()`` to return an iterable of constraints instead of a
  single value.

.. rubric:: Tasks

.. rubric:: Types

.. rubric:: Runtime

- Expose profiling range functions to Python: ``legate.core.start_profiling_range()`` and
  ``legate.core.stop_profiling_range()``.
- Add ``legate.core.runtime.config`` property to access runtime configuration. Note that this
  API is considered an implementation detail and has no guarantee of stability.

.. rubric:: Utilities

.. rubric:: I/O

- Remove ``legate.io.hdf5.kerchunk_read()``. Legate has had first-class support for HDF5
  reads for a while, making this function obsolete.
