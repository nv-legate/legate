     the changes required.


.. rubric:: General

- Legate no longer supports being used with Legion that has ``LEGION_REDOP_HALF`` and
  ``LEGION_REDOP_COMPLEX`` enabled. These have been ported natively to Legate and
  therefore conflict.

.. rubric:: General
  - Add `legate::comm::coll::collAllreduce()` to the collective communication library.

.. rubric:: Data

.. rubric:: Mapping

- Change the type of ``legate::mapping::InstanceMappingPolicy::ordering`` to
  ``std::optional<legate::mapping::DimOrdering>``. With this change, the default instance mapping
  policy now leaves the dimension ordering unspecified.

- Add a new parameter ``ordering`` to ``legate::mapping::StoreMapping::default_mapping()``.

.. rubric:: Partitioning

.. rubric:: Reduction Operators

- Move definition of reduction operators from ``legate/utilities/tyepdefs.h`` to
  ``legate/redop/redop.h``.

.. rubric:: Tasks

.. rubric:: Types

- Add ``legate::Half`` to replace Legion's ``__half`` type.
- Add ``legate::Complex`` to replace Legion's ``complex`` type.
