   * Use the imperative tense: Add, Improve, Change, etc.
   * Use a period (.) at the end of entries.
   * Be concise yet informative.
   * If possible, provide an executive summary of the new feature, but do not

.. rubric:: Tuning

- Add support for setting and reading partitioning threshold in ``legate::ParallelPolicy``, via methods:

  - ``set_partitioning_threshold()`` to set the partitioning threshold for a given
    target processor kind.
  - ``partitioning_threshold()`` to read the partitioning_threshold for a given
    target processor kind.

  This allows users to control partitioning policy for stores for various kinds of target
  processors, e.g., force partitioning of small stores.

- Add native support for HDF5 complex types since HDF5 2.0. Users wanting to read/write
  complex data must have at least HDF5 2.0 installed to enable support.

.. rubric:: Tuning

- Add support for setting and reading partitioning threshold in ``legate.core.ParallelPolicy``,
  via methods:

    - ``set_partitioning_threshold()`` to set partitioning threshold for a target
      processor kind.

    - ``partitioning_threshold()`` to read the partitioning_threshold for a target
      processor kind.

  This functionality allows users to control partitioning decisions of stores, for
  various kinds of target processors, e.g., force partitioning of small stores.

.. rubric:: Types

.. rubric:: Runtime

.. rubric:: Utilities

- Add ``legate.util.has_started.runtime_has_started()`` for testing if the
  legate runtime has started.  (Note that the runtime is automatically started
  by importing ``legate.core``, so this function is only needed in settings
  where ``legate.core`` is not directly imported.)
- Add ``start_runtime`` keyword argument to ``legate.util.info.info()`` and
  ``legate.util.benchmark.benchmark_log()``.  If ``start_runtime=False`` is
  specified, the runtime will not be started as a side-effect of calling those
  functions.
- Add ``legate.core.Runtime.realm_config()``.
