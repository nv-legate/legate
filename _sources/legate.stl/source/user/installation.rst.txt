Legate follow the instructions in the section :ref:`how-do-i-install-legate`.

Building
--------

Legate.STL is a header-only library. To use it,
``#include <legate/experimental/stl.hpp>``. The library's program
entities reside in the ``legate::experimental::stl`` namespace.

All examples in this documentation assume an initial
``namespace stl = legate::experimental::stl;`` directive.
