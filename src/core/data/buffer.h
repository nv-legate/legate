// Note on using temporary buffers in CUDA tasks:
// We use Legion `DeferredBuffer`s, whose lifetime is not connected with the CUDA stream(s) used to
// launch kernels. The buffer is allocated immediately at the point when `create_buffer` called,
// whereas the kernel that uses it is placed on a stream, and may run at a later point. Normally
// `DeferredBuffer`s are deallocated automatically by Legion once all the kernels launched in the
// task are complete. However, `DeferredBuffer`s can also be deallocated immediately using
// `destroy()`, which is useful for operations that want to deallocate intermediate memory as soon
// as possible. This deallocation is not synchronized with the task stream, i.e. it may happen
// before a kernel which uses the buffer has actually completed. This is safe as long as we use the
// same stream on all GPU tasks running on the same device (which is guaranteed by the current
// implementation of `get_cached_stream()`), because then all the actual uses of the buffer are done
// in order on the one stream. It is important that all library CUDA code uses
// `get_cached_stream()`, and all CUDA operations (including library calls) are enqueued on that
// stream exclusively. This analysis additionally assumes that no code outside of Legate is
// concurrently allocating from the eager pool, and that it's OK for kernels to access a buffer even
// after it's technically been deallocated.
