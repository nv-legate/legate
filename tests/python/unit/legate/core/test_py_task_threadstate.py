        # 1. We are the first tasks to *ever* be executed by Legate:
        #
        #    In this case, task_a() should see an empty cache, and create a new
        #    threadstate. On exit, it should then stash the threadstate in the
        #    cache. task_b() then runs, and finds the threadstate in the cache
        #    and reuses it. In total, we should get 1 cache miss, and 1 cache
        #    hit.
        #
        # 2. We are being run after other tasks have run:
        #
        #    task_a() should now see a cached threadstate. It should remove the
        #    threadstate from the cache, use it, then put it back where it
        #    found it. task_b() does the same. So we should have 0 cache
        #    misses, and 2 cache hits.
