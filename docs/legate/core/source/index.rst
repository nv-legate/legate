Welcome to Legate Core's documentation!
=======================================

The Legate project endeavors to democratize computing by making it possible
for all programmers to leverage the power of large clusters of CPUs and GPUs
by running the same code that runs on a desktop or a laptop at scale. Using
this technology, computational and data scientists can develop and test
programs on moderately sized data sets on local machines and then immediately
scale up to larger data sets deployed on many nodes in the cloud or on a
supercomputer without any code modifications.
