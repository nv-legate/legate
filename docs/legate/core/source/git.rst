How to Release
==============

Approach
--------

Our development approach involves protecting the `main` branch so that it
becomes the official release record for any Legate project. Development PRs will
be merged into a release branch, which will be merged into main and tagged only
when the release is ready. The only other merges to `main` are hotfixes.

Development Workflow
--------------------

All new development happens on a release branch named `branch-M.B` where `M` is
the major version and `B` is the minor version number. Minor, single-commit
changes can be pushed directly to this branch. For more significant development
use branches on your personal fork of the main repos, and upstream those changes
through PRs.

Release branches are created from the previous release branch when the decision
has been made to **freeze** the release. To **freeze** a release branch is to
stop new development for the release, and focus on completing outstanding
features and any bugs discovered from testing. Once this **freeze** happens a
new branch `branch-M.C` (where `C=B+1`) is created so development can continue.
Updates to `branch-M.B` can be merged as needed to `branch-M.C`, but generally
will wait until the release is finished. This means that `branch-M.X` (where `X`
is the highest minor version) the latest and greatest code.

Hotfixes (patch releases) related to the current release `M.A` are directly
merged to `main` from a PR and then those changes are also merged to the current
release branches in progress through manual process. 

Minor (and eventually, Major) release development takes place on the current
release branch. PRs can be edited on GitHub to set the target base branch for
merging the PR. It is the reviewerâ€™s responsibility to ensure the PR is targeted
for the correct and planned release branch. Once PRs have passed all tests, they
are merged to their release branch.

Once a release has been reviewed and signoff has been given, a PR is created to
merge the release branch to `main`. After the merge, the automated tagging
process tags and releases a minor version and kicks off the conda builds for the
public release.

Summary
-------

- The `main` branch is the official release history (including hotfixes).
- The tip of `main` is intended to be always working given the testing and
  reviews of merged PRs.
- Hotfixes (patch releases) are automatically tagged for every push to `main`.
- Release branches are used for development of the next releases and **all PRs
  except for hotfixes** are merged to the current release branch.
- A new release branch is created from the previous release branch after the
  release **freeze** (see above).
- After the **freeze** and before the release branch is merged, there are two
  release branches; however, active development should take place in the next
  release branch, while cleanup and finalization happens in the frozen branch.
- This gives the highest numbered `branch-M.X` (modulo hotfixes and unmerged
  frozen release fixes) the latest and greatest code.
- Minor releases are done by creating a PR for the minor release from the
  associated release branch.
- After review and sign off by the team, the PR is merged into main.
