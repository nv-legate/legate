How Do I Install Legate
-----------------------

Legate is available from `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html>`_
on the `legate channel <https://anaconda.org/legate/legate>`_.
Please make sure you have at least conda version 24.1 installed, then create
a new environment containing Legate:

.. code-block:: sh

    conda create -n myenv -c conda-forge -c legate legate

or install it into an existing environment:

.. code-block:: sh

    conda install -c conda-forge -c legate legate

Packages with GPU support are available, and will be chosen automatically by
``conda install`` on systems with GPUs.

In an environment without GPUs available, ``conda install`` will by default
choose a CPU-only package. To install a version with GPU support in such an
environment, use environment variable ``CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA``:

.. code-block:: sh

    CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA="12.2" \
      conda install -c conda-forge -c legate legate

.. _support_matrix:

Support Matrix
--------------

The following table lists Legate's minimum supported versions of major
dependencies.

"Full support" means that the corresponding versions (and all later ones) are
being tested regularly, released as conda packages, and are expected to work.
Please report any incompatibility you find against a fully-supported version
by opening a bug.

"Best-effort support" means that the corresponding versions are not actively
tested, but Legate should be compatible with them if built from source. We
will not actively work to fix any incompatibilities discovered under these
versions, but we accept contributions that fix such incompatibilities.

Legate is tested and guaranteed to be compatible with Volta and later GPU
architectures. You can use Legate with Pascal GPUs as well, but there could
be issues due to lack of independent thread scheduling. Please report any such
issues by opening a bug.

.. _installation_of_mpi_wrapper:

Installation of the Legate MPI wrapper
--------------------------------------

If you encounter runtime failures such as

.. code-block:: sh

   failed to load MPI wrapper: 'some/path/to/liblegate_mpi_wrapper.so' ...

Or if you want to use Legate in combination with a different MPI library than
the one it was compiled against (see the dependencies on the Legate package),
e.g. you are on an HPC cluster and want to use the vendor's MPI library, then
you will need to compile and install the Legate MPI wrapper locally on your
machine. See :ref:`FAQ<mpi_wrapper_faq>` for more information on why this is
needed.

Assuming Legate is installed to a directory called ``INSTALL_PREFIX``, to build
and install the wrappers simply run the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ INSTALL_PREFIX/share/legate/mpi_wrapper/install.bash

This command will build and install the MPI wrappers to the default
installation prefix. In order to build and install the wrappers you will
need to have:

- CMake (at least version 3.0).
- A C++ compiler.
- A local installation of MPI.
- Write access to the installation prefix.

There are several influential environment variables that users may set in order
to control the build and installation process:

- ``CMAKE``: name or path to the ``cmake`` executable.
- ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``, ``PREFIX``, or ``DESTDIR``: path to which the MPI
  wrappers should be installed. If one or more of these variables is set and
  not empty, they are preferred in the order listed. That is,
  ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` will be preferred over ``PREFIX``, which is
  preferred over ``DESTDIR``.
- ``CMAKE_ARGS`` or ``CMAKE_CONFIGURE_ARGS``: if set, arguments to be passed
  to the initial CMake configure command. If both are set,
  ``CMAKE_CONFIGURE_ARGS`` is preferred over ``CMAKE_ARGS``.
- ``CMAKE_BUILD_ARGS``: if set, arguments to be passed to the CMake build
  command.
- ``CMAKE_INSTALL_ARGS``: if set, arguments to be passed to the CMake install
  command.


Installation of the Legate IPython Kernel
-----------------------------------------

Please install Legate, then run the following command to install a default
Jupyter kernel:

.. code-block:: sh

    legate-jupyter

If installation is successful, you will see some output like the following:

.. code-block::

    Jupyter kernel spec Legate_SM_GPU (Legate_SM_GPU) has been installed

``Legate_SM_GPU`` is the default kernel name.

Licenses
--------

This project will download and install additional third-party open source
software projects at install time. Review the license terms of these open
source projects before use.

:ref:`thirdparty`.

Building and Installing from Source
-----------------------------------

Building Legate from source has multiple steps and can involve different
dependencies, depending on your system configuration. For the most up to date
instructions for the latest source code, see the `BUILD.md`_ document in the
`Legate repository`_.
