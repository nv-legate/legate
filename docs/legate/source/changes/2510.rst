Changes: 25.10
==============
..
   STYLE:
   * Capitalize sentences.
   * Use the imperative tense: Add, Improve, Change, etc.
   * Use a period (.) at the end of entries.
   * Be concise yet informative.
   * If possible, provide an executive summary of the new feature, but do not
     just repeat its doc string. However, if the feature requires changes from
     the user, then describe those changes in detail, and provide examples of
     the changes required.


.. rubric:: General

- Add support for CUDA 13.
- Define ``LEGION_DISABLE_DEPRECATED_ENUMS`` in ``legate_defines.h``, which disables the
  use of deprecated Legion enum values. Uses of these values will now result in
  compile-time errors.

C++
---

.. rubric:: General

- Add config option ``--profile-name`` to customize the base filename for profiling
  output.
- Add new UCX networking backend. On supporting builds (``LEGATE_DEFINED(LEGATE_USE_UCX)``
  being ``1``), CPU collectives can be routed through UCX by disabling
  MPI (``LEGATE_CONFIG=--disable-mpi``).
- Remove ``legate/cuda/cuda.h``.
- Remove ``LEGATE_CHECK_CUDA()`` and ``LegateCheckCUDA()``.
- Remove ``LEGATE_CHECK_CUDA_STREAM()`` and ``LegateCheckCUDAStream()``.
- Remove ``LEGATE_THREADS_PER_BLOCK``, ``LEGATE_MIN_CTAS_PER_SM``,
  ``LEGATE_MAX_REDUCTION_CTAS``, and ``LEGATE_WARP_SIZE``. These were internal symbols
  accidentally exposed via ``legate/cuda/cuda.h`` and have been privatized as part of its
  removal.

.. rubric:: Data

- Make ``legate::ScopedAllocator`` copy-constructible.
- Add ``legate::ScopedAllocator::allocate_aligned()``.
- Add ``legate::ScopedAllocator::allocate_type()``.

.. rubric:: Mapping

.. rubric:: Partitioning

- Add overload of ``legate::align()`` that takes a span of variables to align as a
  convenience for aligning multiple task arguments.
- Add overload of ``legate::broadcast()`` that takes a span of variables to broadcast as a
  convenience for broadcasting multiple task arguments.
- Add overload of ``legate::broadcast()`` that takes a span of pairs of variables and axes
  to broadcast as a convenience for broadcasting multiple task arguments.
- Add ``LogicalStore::get_partition()``. This method allows users to access the
  partition used by the runtime for optimizing task launches and data movement.

.. rubric:: Tasks

.. rubric:: Types

.. rubric:: Runtime

.. rubric:: Utilities

- Remove previously deprecated classes ``legate::cuda::StreamPool`` and
  ``legate::cuda::StreamView``.

.. rubric:: I/O

- Change HDF5 Virtual File Driver (VFD) GPUDirectStorage (GDS) to enabled by default if
  Legate was built with support for it and Legate determines that GDS is likely to
  work. Previously this feature was disabled but could be toggled on via the
  ``--io-use-vfd-gds`` LEGATE_CONFIG option.

  Users should note that there is presently no way to reliably know ahead of time
  (i.e. before attempting cuFile calls) whether the filesystem supports GDS. Legate
  employs several heuristics to determine viability that -- while rare -- can provide both
  false positives *and* false negatives. Users relying on I/O performance who want this
  feature enabled should ensure it is on via the flag (as before), while users that
  encounter false positives should disable it via the flag and raise a bug report at
  https://github.com/nv-legate/legate/issues.
- Add ``legate::io::hdf5::to_file()`` to write a ``legate::LogicalArray()`` to file using
  HDF5.

Python
------

.. rubric:: General

.. rubric:: Data

.. rubric:: Mapping

- Add ``legate.core.DimOrdering`` and ``legate.core.DimOrderingKind`` for
  dimension ordering
- Add an optional argument of type ``DimOrderingKind`` to
  ``legate.core.Runtime.create_from_buffer()``
  that denotes the dimension ordering kind

.. rubric:: Partitioning

- Change ``legate.core.align()`` to return an iterable of constraints instead of a single
  value.
- Change ``legate.core.broadcast()`` to return an iterable of constraints instead of a
  single value.
- Add ``legate.core.LogicalStore.partition``. This property allows users to access
  the partition used by the runtime for optimizing task launches and data movement.

.. rubric:: Tasks

.. rubric:: Types

.. rubric:: Runtime

- Expose profiling range functions to Python: ``legate.core.start_profiling_range()`` and
  ``legate.core.stop_profiling_range()``.
- Add ``legate.core.runtime.config`` property to access runtime configuration. Note that this
  API is considered an implementation detail and has no guarantee of stability.

.. rubric:: Utilities

.. rubric:: I/O

- Add ``legate.io.hdf5.from_file_batched()`` to read a HDF5 file in batches.
- Remove ``legate.io.hdf5.kerchunk_read()``. Legate has had first-class support for HDF5
  reads for a while, making this function obsolete.
- Add ``legate.io.hdf5.to_file()`` to write a ``legate.core.LogicalArray`` to file using
  HDF5.
