Installation of the Legate MPI wrapper
======================================

If you want to use Legate in combination with a different MPI library than the
one it was compiled against (see the dependencies on the Legate package), e.g.,
you are on an HPC cluster and want to use the vendor's MPI library, then you
will need to compile and install the Legate MPI wrapper locally on your machine.
See :ref:`FAQ<mpi_wrapper_faq>` for more information on why this is needed.  The
MPI mismatch may manifest in failures such as

.. code-block:: sh

   failed to load MPI wrapper: 'some/path/to/liblegate_mpi_wrapper.so' ...

In order to build and install the wrapper you will need to have:

- CMake (at least version 3.22.1).
- A C++ compiler.
- A local installation of MPI.
- Write access to the target install directory.

Additionally, there are several environment variables that you can set in order to control
the build and installation process:

.. _influential_mpi_wrapper_vars:

- ``CMAKE``: name or path to the ``cmake`` executable.
- ``CMAKE_ARGS`` or ``CMAKE_CONFIGURE_ARGS``: if set, arguments to be passed to the
  initial CMake configure command. If both are set, ``CMAKE_CONFIGURE_ARGS`` is preferred
  over ``CMAKE_ARGS``.
- ``CMAKE_BUILD_ARGS``: if set, arguments to be passed to the CMake build command.
- ``CMAKE_INSTALL_ARGS``: if set, arguments to be passed to the CMake install command.
- ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``, ``PREFIX``, or ``DESTDIR``: path to which the MPI wrappers
  should be installed. If one or more of these variables is set and not empty, they are
  preferred in the order listed. That is, ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` will be preferred over
  ``PREFIX``, which is preferred over ``DESTDIR``.


Conda installation
------------------

Assume Legate is already installed in a conda environment named ``myenv``. We need to
activate this environment and install the wrapper packages that contain the scripts
necessary to build the wrappers (note the custom channel ``legate/label/gex`` in the
install command):

.. code-block:: sh

   $ conda activate myenv
   $ conda install -c conda-forge -c legate/label/gex legate-mpi-wrapper

When the wrapper package is installed, the instructions for building the wrapper are
displayed:

.. code-block:: sh

   To finish configuring the Legate MPI wrapper, activate your environment and run
   /path-to-myenv/mpi-wrapper/build-mpi-wrapper.sh

To build the wrapper, first activate the ``myenv`` environment:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ conda activate myenv


   --------------------- CONDA/MPI_WRAPPER/ACTIVATE.SH -----------------------

   LEGATE_MPI_WRAPPER=

Note that when the environment is activated without the wrapper built, the activation
script for the wrapper package sets the ``LEGATE_MPI_WRAPPER`` environment variable to an
empty value, since there is no wrapper shared library to find yet.

After the environment is activated, we can build the MPI wrapper:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ /path-to-myenv/mpi-wrapper/build-mpi-wrapper.sh

Once the wrapper is built, reactivate the environment to set the necessary environment
variables:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ conda deactivate


   --------------------- CONDA/MPI_WRAPPER/DEACTIVATE.SH -----------------------

   +++ unset LEGATE_MPI_WRAPPER
   +++ set +x
   $ conda activate myenv


   --------------------- CONDA/MPI_WRAPPER/ACTIVATE.SH -----------------------

   LEGATE_MPI_WRAPPER=/path-to-myenv/mpi-wrapper/lib64/liblgcore_mpi_wrapper.so

Note that the activation script now successfully located the MPI wrapper shared library.

It might also be useful to remove the MPI conda package that Legate was compiled against
(typically ``openmpi``), to make sure that there is only one choice of MPI to use:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ conda uninstall --force openmpi


Source build
------------

.. note::

   When building Legate from source, the MPI wrapper is generally **not needed**. The
   build system will automatically compile and link a default wrapper (using whatever
   implementation of MPI it finds on your system) for you. It is only needed if:

   #. You wish to use a different flavor of MPI at runtime than that which Legate was
      built against.
   #. You wish to package Legate yourself, and want to provide build instructions for
      downstream users, or perhaps invoke the wrapper build during your own package
      installation.


Assuming Legate is installed to a directory called ``/path/to/prefix``, to build and
install the wrappers simply run the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ /path/to/prefix/share/legate/mpi_wrapper/install.bash


The same command also exists in the source directory, under the same directory tree:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ ${LEGATE_DIR}/share/legate/mpi_wrapper/install.bash

This command will build and install the MPI wrappers to the default installation
prefix. To change the default installation prefix, or supply additional arguments to the
build, see the list of :ref:`Influential MPI variables <influential_mpi_wrapper_vars>`.

Once the wrapper is built, Legate must still be instructed to load it (and not the default
wrapper which was built during the original source build). To do so, you must set the
``LEGATE_MPI_WRAPPER`` environment variable to the absolute path to the installed shared
library. Assuming the wrapper was installed to ``/my/prefix/directory``:

.. code-block:: sh

   # On Linux
   $ export LEGATE_MPI_WRAPPER="/my/prefix/directory/lib/legate_mpi_wrapper.so"
   # On macOS
   $ export LEGATE_MPI_WRAPPER="/my/prefix/directory/lib/legate_mpi_wrapper.dylib"


As with any environment variable, you can either ``export`` it once (as above), or set it
before invoking a Legate application:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ LEGATE_MPI_WRAPPER="/path/to/legate_mpi_wrapper.so" ./my_legate_app ...
