Welcome to Legate.STL
=====================

Legate.STL is a C++ library that provides an STL-like iterface for
working with the Legate distributed runtime.

It provides:

* an STL container-like wrapper for a Legate logical store,

* views of physical storage as ``std::mdspan`` objects,

* range-like adaptors for projecting, filtering, and slicing logical
  and physical storage, and

* a set of STL-like algorithms for operating on ranges of slices.
