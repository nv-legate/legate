===============================
Use of A.I. In Development Work
===============================

The use of artificial intelligence tools in software development introduces new
challenges, particularly around code quality, traceability, and maintainability. The
Legate project allows the use of AI-assisted tools to aid in code generation, provided the
resulting contributions are consistent with the project's licensing terms and quality
standards.

Regardless of how code is produced, contributors are fully responsible for understanding,
validating, and reviewing any code they submit. AI-generated code must be treated with the
same scrutiny as handwritten code. Contributors are expected to ensure that such code
meets the Legate project's expectations for correctness, clarity, and maintainability.

Submissions that include code the contributor cannot explain, debug, or justify during
review are not acceptable. Reviewers cannot be expected to validate code that even the
author does not understand. Maintaining high-quality contributions is essential to project
sustainability, and contributions that fall short of these standards will be rejected or
removed as necessary.

While Legate maintains a permissive stance on the use of AI tools, they must not be used
as a substitute for thoughtful engineering judgment, rigorous testing, and careful code
review.
